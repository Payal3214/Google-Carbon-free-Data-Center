üåç Google Carbon-Free Data Centers:

This project investigates how Google data centers can transition to 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by analyzing electricity generation, grid emissions, tariffs, incentives, and demand profiles in India and the United States. Using real-world datasets from government sources (POSOCO, CEA, EIA, OGD) combined with manually built components, the project creates a unified framework for comparing renewable penetration, electricity prices, and policy landscapes across regions.

The analysis includes building renewable time-series datasets, mapping state-wise tariffs, simulating demand‚Äìsupply mismatches (latency), and estimating carbon intensity based on grid factors. The findings aim to provide insights into the feasibility of achieving 24/7 carbon-free operations, highlight policy and economic trade-offs, and suggest strategies for future clean energy‚Äìdriven digital infrastructure.
